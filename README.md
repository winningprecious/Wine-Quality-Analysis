 Wine-Quality-Analysis
Analyzed the Wine Quality dataset using Excel and Python to uncover key factors influencing wine ratings through stats and visualizations.
This project explores the Wine Quality dataset to uncover insights into the factors that affect wine quality.  
I used Excel for quick data cleaning and pivot analysis, and Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for deeper statistical exploration and visualizations.

 Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Descriptive Statistics)
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Key Insights
- Strong positive relationship between alcohol content and overall wine quality  
- Volatile acidity shows a negative correlation with taste ratings  
- Quality scores are normally distributed, with most wines rated average (5–6)  
- Visualizations highlighted key drivers that separate high-quality from low-quality wines
